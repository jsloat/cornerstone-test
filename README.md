# Cornerstone test

This is just copying the Cornerstone example from here: [Basic Stack Viewport Usage](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/stackbasic).

I wasn't able to import some of the utilities that this example uses, even though they are present in my `node_modules` directory. Probably a webpack config issue or something. So in this demo I just manually copy-pasted the necessary util code, which makes this a bit messy to read.

## Run

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

It claims to run on [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/), but I'm probably missing some configuration somewhere. I'm able to access at [http://192.168.4.232:3000/](http://192.168.4.232:3000/).
